# Hi, I'm Ellie 👋🏼

I'm a software engineer by trade and a story-teller at heart. I believe both technology and art have incredible capabilities to transform lives and uplift communities, helping folks to imagine new worlds for themselves. I am passionate about equity within the tech industry for marginalized folks which led to me learn how to code at <a href="https://resilientcoders.org">Resilient Coders</a> and to lead an employee resource group at my previous company to support engineers from non-traditional backgrounds. <br /><br />

Having a background in advocacy work and organizing drives me to always "take one more". Every challenge we overcome or new heights that we reach, I believe it is our privelege, responsibilty, and joy to help others. I aim to use my skills as a developer to make resources more accessible for those who want to take a non-traditional path into coding and how to do so sustainably. 

### My Tech Stack and Skills:
Fluent: HTML & CSS | JavaScript ES6 | React | Express | Node.js | SQL & NoSQL <br />
Familiar: PHP | Java | Python | Android Development (I worked on a ton of different cool projects on the job, requiring different tools!)

### Currently I'm working on:
- a safety app for BIPOC communities
- practicing data-structures and algorithms
- staying sane in the midst of a global pandemic
